   <https://lists.andrew.cmu.edu/mailman/listinfo/delphi-covidcast-api>`_ to be
   notified of package updates, new data sources, corrections, and other
   updates.

.. warning :: If you use data from the COVIDcast API to power a public product,
   dashboard, app, or other service, please download the data you need and store
   it centrally rather than making API requests for every user. Our server
   resources are limited and cannot support high-volume interactive use.

   <https://covidcast.cmu.edu/terms-of-use.html>`_, noting that the data is a
   research product and not warranted for a particular purpose.
